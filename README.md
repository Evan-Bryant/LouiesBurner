# LouiesBurner: GVSU Sports Reporting Bot

Hi, my name is Louie, and I am the mascot here at Grand Valley! Over the fall semester, I will be reporting on Grand Valley sporting events by making Twitter posts about Player and Team Statistics.

## üìñ Description
This project is a sports reporting bot designed to provide updates and highlight notable performances for GVSU Women‚Äôs Volleyball. Using **Python 3**, we will scrape data from the official [GVSU Lakers Website](https://gvsulakers.com/sports/womens-volleyball/stats/2024) and use the **Tweepy API** to generate daily tweets about ongoing events, recent games, and player stats.

## üîç Features
The bot will automatically create a post based on one or two or these features:
- **Player and Team Statistics**: Highlight key performance stats, such as total points, assists, and standout player performances.
- **Historical Callbacks**: Reference previous seasons, records, and milestone achievements.
- **Event Notifications**: Post reminders for upcoming games and events, along with match times and locations.
- **Player Shoutouts**: Congratulate individual players on their achievements, such as breaking records or earning awards.
